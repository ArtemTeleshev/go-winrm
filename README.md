Unsupported Go lang WinRM client library
-----

This was originally forked from [masterzen](https://github.com/masterzen/winrm). There are some bug fixes in here and a bunch of other ideas that I was toying with, but ultimately these should get back upstream. If you want to help do that, great! I use this library currently for my Packer WinRM communicator.
